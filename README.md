Hi, I'm Ahmad Zaki (@ahmadzakey).
Currently, I'm focused on deepening my knowledge in Data Science, specifically in Python, Power BI, and Machine Learning. Although I'm still in the learning phase, I recently completed my analysis on regression and classification models, which has enhanced my understanding of these techniques. I just wrapped up my Data Analyst training, and now I'm progressing through my Data Science journey, diving deeper into more complex topics like time series analysis and natural language processing.

I'm always looking to collaborate on Data Analytics projects and expand my skills. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate: zakey53319@email.com.
